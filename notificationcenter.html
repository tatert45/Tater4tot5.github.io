    <h1>WP Engine: Notification Center</h1>
    <h3 style="line-height:1.6">Tools used: Figma, Miro, Dovetail, Pendo </h3>

    <p> I was the lead designer on our platform's first-ever in-app communication hub. Previously, our methods of communicating with customers included a convoluted system of emails, SMS alerts, and pesky in-app notifications like banners and toasts. The new "Notification Center" would be a streamlined way to communicate with customers. Additionally, it would be a central place for customers set and manage their notification preferences. Finally, having an in-app Notification Center would allow us to track customer behavior and allow for a more personalized, data-driven product experience. </p>

    <div class="problem">
      <h1>My Role</h1>
      <p>Because this was a new feature, and one that would impact not only our external customers, but our internal customers as well, this project required buy-in and involvement from multiple  stakeholders. I was able to achieve this by partnering with research and organizing a design workshop at the beginning of this project. I was able to collaborate with the lead PM and engineers working on this project and involve various teams both in and outside of our product department throughout the design process.

    <h1>My Process</h1>
    <div class="projectpicleft"><span class="hovertext">(Click to enlarge)</span><img class="grcompare" src="images/notifications1.png"onclick="myFunction(this);" alt="Prior to this work, customers received messaging through multiple different channels and had little control over notification settings and preferences."></div><div class="projectdiv"><div class="numberheader"><img class="number" src="images/number1.png"><h2>Research, Discover & Define</h2>
    </div>
    <p>Prior to this work, customers received messaging through multiple different channels and had no way of customizing the types of messages they received. Additionally, there was no central method or process for sending comms to WP Engine customers. I started this project with a kickoff call with the PM and engineers and a representative of our UX research team to better determine the goals and timeline for this project.

    <p>I requested an audit of all existing types and channels of messages being sent to customers including things like modals, banners, toasts, etc. all the way to e-mails and SMS messages. In order to gain customer empathy, it was important to understand all of the ways we were currently communicating with customers. My research partner and I then gathered customer feedback from existing customer interviews relating to communication from WP Engine.

    <p>Finally, I recognized that this project would impact multiple teams, so my next step was to establish key stakeholders and conduct a design-thinking workshop .</p>

    <p>After gathering research from customer interviews and the audit, I created a Miro board which I shared with stakeholders from multiple departments including our Customer Support, Marketing, and Customer Success teams. I then invited these stakeholders to participate in a design-thinking workshop. Participants were tasked with helping us pinpoint the key problems to be solved with communicating to our customers and then ideate on "how might we?" create a better experience.

    <p>Following the workshop, I then read up on UX best practices for in-product and external customer communication. I read several case studies from similar products and features and was able to gather inspiration from competitors. I also used our sister-product, Flywheel's in-app communication center for inspiration, and was able to take customer feedback from this experience and apply it to my designs.

    <p>Our timeline for this project was relatively condensed so I started with mid-fi designs and rough prototypes which were tested with internal team members. After gathering feedback from design crit and getting sign-off from the PM and engineers, we then decided to move onto hi-fi designs which would be released in a Beta-version of the Notification Center. This Beta release included a "Give us feedback" CTA where customers would be able to provide feature feedback.

    <div class="projectpicleft"><span class="hovertext">(Click to enlarge)</span><img class="grcompare" src="images/notifications3.png" onclick="myFunction(this);" alt="Our Beta release included messaging and a walkthrough introducing customers this new feature, which we used to track engagement and gather feedback."></div><div class="projectdiv"><div class="numberheader"><img class="number" src="images/number3.png"><h2>Test, Iterate, improve</h2></div>
    <p> Shortly after we released the Beta version of this Notification Center, I had to shift attention to other projects and hand off my designs to a junior designer. However, our Beta release included messaging and a walkthrough introducing customers this new feature. We were able to track user engagement in this way. I also included a link in the design for customers to easily provide feedback on the new feature.</p>
    <p>Given more time, I would have loved to observe how customers were using this feature. There were quite a few questions I still had when we released the Beta version, and I had to make assumptions in some of my design decisions.</p>
    <p>While I was able to effectively collaborate with multiple stakeholders on this project to make informed decisions, I would have liked more research involvement to gather customer feedback. All in all, it was a lesson in partnering with multiple stakeholders, conducting my own research and collaborating with engineers to get the best possible MVP in a short time period.</p></div>
