    <h1>WP Engine: Notification Center</h1>
    <h3 style="line-height:1.6">Tools used: Figma, Miro, Dovetail </h3>

    <p> I was the lead designer on a new, in-app notification feature for WP Engineâ€™s User Portal. This was meant to be a central location for customers to receive and set preferences for all product-related communication from WP Engine. Further, the notification center would be a way to streamline a previously convuleted system of communicating with customers, and, ideally, allow us to track customer behavior and allow for a more personalized, data-driven product experience.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <h1>My Role</h1>
      <p>Because this was a new feature, and one that would impact not only our external customers, but our internal customers as well, this project required buy-in and involvement from multiple different stakeholders. I was able to achieve this by partnering with researach, organizing a design workshop and collaborating with my PM, engineers and various teams both in and outside of our product department throughout the design process.
      </p>

    <h1>My Process</h1>
    <div class="projectpicleft"><img class="grcompare" src="images/notifications1.png"></div><div class="projectdiv"><div class="numberheader"><img class="number" src="images/number1.png"><h2>Research, Discover & Define</h2>
    </div>
    <p>Prior to this work, customers received messaging through multiple different channels and had no way of customizing the types of messages they received. Additionally, there was no central method or process for sending comms to WP Engine customers. I was able to partner with research to gather customer feedback from existing customer interviews relating to communication from WP Engine. I was also able to chat with internal team members from Marketing, Customer Success and Customer Support to identify their knowledge of and painpoints with our current methods of customer communication. Finally, I requested an audit of all existing types and channels of messages being sent to customers including things like modals, banners, toasts, etc. all the way to e-mails and SMS messages. </p>

    <div class="projectpicright"><img class="grcompare" src="images/notifications2.png"></div><div class="projectdiv"><div class="numberheader"><img class="number" src="images/number2.png"><h2>Ideation and Design</h2></div>
    <p>After gathering research and with a better understanding of current communication methods, I then partnered with the PM of this project to conduct a design-thinking workshop. We invited key stakeholders from multiple departments including our Customer Support, Marketing, and Customer Success teams. Participants were tasked with helping us pinpoint the key problems to be solved with communicating to our customers and then ideate on "how might we?" create a better experience. In addition to the workshop, I read up on product design best practices for communicating with customers, read case studies of related work, and gather inspiration from competitors.
    Our timeline for this project was relatively condensed so I started with mid-fi designs and rough prototypes. After gathering feedback from design crit and getting signoff from the PM and engineers on this project, I then quickly moved to hi-fi designs which were built and released to a Beta version of the notification center. This Beta release included a "Give us feedback" button within the notification drawer where users were able to provide feedback on their experience.

    <p> Shortly after we released the Beta version of this Notification Center, I had to shift attention to other projects and hand off my designs to a junior designer. I would have loved to have had more time learn and observe how customers were using this feature. There were quite a few questions I still had when we released the Beta version, and I had to make assumptions in some of my design decisions. While I was able to effectively collaborate with multiple stakeholders on this project and make informed decisions based on their involvement, I did feel their was more opportunity for customer feedback--especially when it came to managing notifications and setting up preferences. All in all, it was a lesson in partnering with multiple stakeholders, research and engineers to get the best possible MVP in a short time period.</p></div>
